 * Returns all posts as an array of paginated tags.

 * Each element includes n number of posts as well as some basic information of that tag to pump into `_includes/partials/paged.njk`
 * This is because we can not paginate something already paginated... Pagination is effectively a loop, and we can't have an embedded loop O^2.
